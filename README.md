Change Log:
- Added
# Calculation and display of average prices for menu items, grouped by course (Starters, Mains, Desserts) on the Home screen.
# A "Save Changes" Button that redirects the Chef back to the Home Screen
# A feature that allows undoing the removal of an item before pressing "Save Changes"
# The ability of filtering the menu Items based on Course has been implemented.

- Changed
# Updated the Home screen layout to include a new section for displaying average prices
# The Layout and Color of the Home Screen button have been modified to become more visually appealing.

- Improvement
# Code has been made to be more organized by separating reusable components (MenuList, AveragePrices, FilterButtons) into new files under the new folder "Components".
# The buttons on FilterMenuScreen now match the style and behavior of the HomeScreen.
